	This is a server-sided module script that contains realistic animations based on which part you are damaged on. 
	The script also includes blood dripping visual effects, as well as sound effects of screams, pain.
 	Blackouts/Knockouts can occur if you lose too much blood or if you are injured in the head. 
	Additionally, you can also face a loss of a limb if the limb is damaged, for example, a loss of a leg.

        ☆ Leg Injury:
        Sustaining an injury to your legs will result in reduced mobility, with a greater impact if both legs are injured.

        ☆ Arm Injury:
        Injuring your arms will compromise your precision in equipment usage, leading to decreased effectiveness.

        ☆ Torso Injury:
        Affecting your torso will diminish your precision and control when utilizing equipment.

        ☆ Head Injury:
        An injury to the head can cause intermittent blackouts and blurriness, potentially leading to immobilization depending on the severity.

        + Additionally, failure to seek medical attention may result in unconsciousness due to blood loss, with a risk of fatality if not treated promptly within a few minutes of losing consciousness.

        + Following an injury, a Blood Dripping visual effect (VFX) will be activated.

        + There will be a separate blood loss bar (not visible to players). If that depletes, you will be knocked out. If not attended to within a few minutes, you will perish. 
	If you move while having a moderate injury, you will start to bleed out again (the more you move the worse it gets). The blood loss bar will be replenished when given medication.

        + Medical Personal will be able to heal players at medical beds.
	
        + Medical Personal will receive pop-up menus to synthesize the injury and perform the basics of healing for them. 
	The player's body part being interacted with will be highlighted with, green indicating no problems, yellow indicating a light injury, orange indicating a light injury, and red indicating severe injury requiring immediate attention.
